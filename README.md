### Steps -

# 1. Clone the repo

```bash
    git clone httpsPATH
```

# 2. Create virtual env

```bash
    python -m venv "virtual environment name"
#    conda create -n venvel python=3.8 -y
```

# 3. Activate virtual env

to activate on Windows
```bash
   .\venvel\Scripts\activate
```
## venvel is the virtual env name
to activate in MacOS or Linux
```bash
   source venvel/bin/activate
```
### for our project, activate file is present in path - venvel->Scripts->activate
### so command will be -  source venvel/Scripts/activate

```bash
#    conda activate venvel
```

### After activation, your terminal prompt should change (typically showing (venv)), indicating that the virtual environment is active. Now, any packages you install will be isolated to this environment. ###

# 4. Install requirements

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
